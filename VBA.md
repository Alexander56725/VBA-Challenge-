`	`Analyzing returns for stock tickers over the course of 2017 and 2018 to demonstrate through data over the course of 2 years which stocks had the best annualized returns to make  informative decisions on where to put funds into. 



**II. Purpose**

`	`Steve’s parents were looking to invest money into a stock and Steve wanted to do a more thorough analysis into which stock would be the best performer instead of Steve’s parents in what they thought would be the best outcome (they were assuming heavily traded stocks always had the best outcome). 



**III.  Analysis and Challenges**

`	`Looking at the cross comparison of 2017 and 2018 for the stock tickers, we can deduce that 2017 was a far better year for the 10 specific stocks than what transpired in 2018. A         challenge that I faced while doing the VBA coding was a simple misspelling of any word could throw off your code. I did this for instance and it took me about 50 minutes to locate exactly where I had the misspelling to correct it. 



**IV.  Summary**

`	`Disadvantages of refactoring code could be if the code is very long. Given if it was that long, one throw off could make most of the code not executable. Also, when adding this code a new coder looking into the code may not exactly know what code is going on and may confuse the incoming person.

`	`Advantages of refactoring would be good maintenance of code, making the code organized and clean, but also to update the code too. 

`	`Advantages of using refactored VBA is a cleaner script for the VBA and it being updated, a clear disadvantage to the refactored VBA code would be if a new person came into the picture and couldn't exactly deduce what the code was stating.
